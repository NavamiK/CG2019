# CG2019

As part of the practical exercises for [Computer Graphics Winter 2019-20](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/courses/cg1-2019/), I incrementally built my own ray tracing system, which then was used to generate a high-quality rendering for the end-of-term rendering competition.

Some reference images that highlight the features and capabilities of the rendering engine
